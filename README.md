# Auth Service

An Express 5 authentication API backed by MongoDB. It supports local email/password
authentication, rotating access and refresh sessions, email OTP flows, Google and
Facebook OAuth, user profile management, and admin user management.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- MongoDB
- An SMTP/Resend email configuration for verification and password recovery
- Google/Facebook OAuth credentials when those routes are enabled

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env # if an example file is available, otherwise create .env manually
npm test
npm start
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:3001` by default. Check it with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

For copy-paste requests covering every endpoint, see
[MANUAL_ROUTE_TESTING.md](MANUAL_ROUTE_TESTING.md).

## Environment Variables

At minimum, configure:

```env
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth_service
JWT_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
```

Recommended token configuration:

```env
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=replace-with-a-different-access-secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=replace-with-a-different-refresh-secret
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRY=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRY=90d
```

Application and cookie settings:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax
COOKIE_SECURE=false
```

Email settings can use Resend or the configured email provider:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
MAIL_FROM=no-reply@example.com
```

OAuth settings:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/auth/google/callback
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your-facebook-app-id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your-facebook-app-secret
FACEBOOK_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/auth/facebook/callback
```

Never commit `.env` files, credentials, or API keys.

## Authentication Model

Successful login and OAuth callbacks set two HTTP-only cookies:

- `access_token`: short-lived token used by protected requests
- `refresh_token`: long-lived rotating session token used by `/refresh`

Protected routes accept the access cookie or an authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Refresh tokens are stored as hashes in the user document. Refreshing rotates the
session, and logout revokes the current refresh session and clears both cookies.

## API Routes

The service mounts authentication routes under `/api/auth`.

### Public routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Service health check |
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Create a local account and send verification OTP |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate and issue cookies |
| POST | `/api/auth/refresh` | Rotate the refresh session |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Revoke the refresh session and clear cookies |
| GET, POST | `/api/auth/verify-email` | Verify an email OTP |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password` | Send a password-reset OTP |
| POST | `/api/auth/resend-otp` | Resend a verification or reset OTP |
| POST | `/api/auth/reset-password` | Set a new password using an OTP |
| GET | `/api/auth/google` | Start Google OAuth |
| GET | `/api/auth/google/callback` | Complete Google OAuth |
| GET | `/api/auth/facebook` | Start Facebook OAuth |
| GET | `/api/auth/facebook/callback` | Complete Facebook OAuth |

### Authenticated routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/auth/session` | Return the current user |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Return the current user |
| PUT | `/api/auth/profile` | Update username and/or email |
| PUT | `/api/auth/change-password` | Change the current password |
| DELETE | `/api/auth/account` | Delete the current account |

### Admin routes

Admin routes require a valid access token with role `admin`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/auth/admin/users` | List users with pagination and search |
| GET | `/api/auth/admin/users/:id` | Get one user |
| PUT | `/api/auth/admin/users/:id` | Update user fields or role |
| DELETE | `/api/auth/admin/users/:id` | Delete another user |

## Validation

- Emails are trimmed and lowercased.
- Passwords must contain at least 8 characters.
- Usernames must contain 3 to 30 characters.
- OTP values must be exactly 6 digits.
- Profile and admin update bodies reject unknown fields.
- Admin roles are `user`, `admin`, or `business`.

Errors use this shape:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Request validation failed",
  "errors": []
}
```

## Commands

```bash

npm test      # Run the Node smoke tests
npm start     # Start the production-style server
npm run dev   # Start with nodemon
```

## Security Notes

- Use separate, strong JWT secrets in production.
- Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` when serving over HTTPS.
- Restrict `CORS_ORIGIN` to trusted frontend origins.
- Keep OAuth, database, email, and JWT credentials outside source control.
- Do not expose password hashes, OTP values, or refresh tokens in API responses.
